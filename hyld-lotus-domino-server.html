Hello! A colleague needs to configure a handful of IBM Lotus Domino servers, release 9.0.1FP5 November 22, 2015. The servers work, but their Message-IDs terminate with the string "@LocalDomaingt" and, as a result, all e-mails bounch back as SPAM. Given the repetitive task or replacing "LocalDomain" with "example.org" in the right spot, and the fact that we are green to Domino, is there a powershell script that can save the day? Any reference would be most welcome. Thank. Отзыв о сайте. Напишите нам, если не нашли нужную информацию на странице, или оставьте отзыв о работе сайта, чтобы мы сделали его лучше.

I want to use logstash output email so I can get alerts when certain syslog messages arrive on my logging machine. The problem is I can't for the life of me figure out how to make sendmail use a Lotus Domino server to relay mail. Does anyone know a way to set this up?

A decade before the Civil Rights Act, IBM's chairman wrote Policy Letter #4 — history's first corporate mandate on equal employment, for everyone. The following tale takes place at my previous place of employment. I was working at a smallish research center (~40 staff) in the Midwest as one of their scientists. We lost our sys admin/desktop support/all-in-one IT guy and I was volunteered/offered to fill in until we found a new one. Here's a different tale (https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/439uwh/never_mind_we_figured_it_out/) from that time. Let's just say it was a bumpy 8 months. We were stationed at a large univer.

I am supposed to get a rough quote for a SAN and VM hosts by the end of the day. I've never spec'd out a SAN before so I'm clueless as where to start, what extra equipment I'll need, etc. About the only thing I've gathered from here is that EMC and Equallogic seem to be the least complained about.

No, we don't have Lotus Notes nor have I ever had to deal with it but that doesn't stop a call getting routed to me because their email guys say it's "a setting at our end". A good start! 30 seconds of Google-Fu tells me that Lotus Notes can be configured to not allow forwarding / replying / printing of emails marked as confidential. Get the email resent as non-confidential and away we go. So learnt something new this morning if nothing. OK, like the title says, I've been deemed the Lotus admin, mainly because I asked if Lotus is able to do this or that. I have absolutely NO experience maintaining any sort of Email Systems. So now that I am officially running Lotus, I have to learn Traveler, Notes 8.5.3, and Domino Server.and whatever else I need.

Hello all, I have a client wanting to access their Lotus Database that has 200k entries via Windows RDS. Currently they are using VMWare Horizon, which brings them to Win 7, and from there they have the Lotus icon. The client used an IT group, but they have gone out of business and I have not had an opportunity to remotely connect to see what they are really working with. Is it safe to assume that they already have Lotus on a Windows server? Not a sysadmin myself, but am in tech sales So due to some recent downsizing within our company, there have been quite a few roles left wide open. One of these roles have been shifted over to our group, a Lotus Notes Domino admin. I am thinking about volenteering to take this system on as I'm still young in my career and am trying to be a "go-getter". The thing is, I have no idea what this system is like or what it does. Does anyone have any experiencing administrating this kind of system? How hard is it to pick up? Are certifications. My company just recently brought on a small company that has been using Lotus Notes / Domino for years. I work for a small MSP and I'm mostly in charge of handling email issues. All of our clients run Microsoft Exchange and today is the first time that I have seen Lotus Notes. I know that the version is Domino 8.5.1 and I have a computer with Domino Admin on it. Any helpful suggestions or tips on how to manage this thing. UPDATE Alright, interview is over! Well, it is a jack of all trades job. There is two IT people at this location, one a programmer, the other, me.

I know those two brands probably give you flashbacks just thinking about them. I don't have that much experience in this field. I will be interviewing for an internship soon. It's the first position I've been able to even meet with anyone about. I got to chat with the IT group briefly and they seem nice. The manager asked me if I knew anything about Lotus. I told him AFAIK it's an alternative to Exchange but have zero experience with it. He mentioned 
Just lurking on this thread ( reminded me how much Lotus Notes is feared and loathed. I recall hearing about it here and there, and a former boss stuck me at being totally enthralled by it (that was something like 20 years ago ± 2 years), but I have never used it personally. So, why does Lotus Notes sucks Beginning with Domino version R4 it has integration with the Web, and the server it self becomes a HTTP-server. Another produces of Domino Web-server put new efficiency (for case servlet managers, supported JVM types upgrade, etc). To give you basic image and abstracting from facts we'll speak about two key Domino Web-server functions: 1. Domino Web-server may be the full-featured HTTP-server. In other words, it can offer fixed (or conditionally static) files as the answer HTTP-browser's.

We just migrated from Lotus notes (\ gasp\ ) to office 365 however due to the lack of management on our domino servers the mailfiles are huge averaging 25-50 gig in size. We purchased some software (BinaryTree) and the migrations are going through with a few hicups Eventually the mailfiles end up in office 365 this is where the fun really begins ( we have very slow links some averaging 5mb to 10mb) Without any policies in outlook 2016 the user now has to download a couple We have a fresh Exchange Online/O365 infrastructure to build as a destination for migrated Lotus Domino mailboxes. Management is going back and forth over whether we should build this new infrastructure to include an on-premise Exchange Server in Hybrid Configuration.
