                            <p> I'm not a DJ. I can't spin or beatmatch to save my life. I am a producer however, and usually, our live shows are more live based Ableton stuff. Normally, when I do (rare) solo sets, I do a stripped down versions of our duo sets of our music and do my vocals and such overtop of the backing stems, and since our sets are created to flow nice, mixing them is a bit easier - especially since they're all in the same genre. I've been asked to play in the chill/eclectic room for an event and I'm really. # Tuesday, 08.01.2019 Time (GMT +1) Category Sub-Category Team 1 Team 2 Reward Pool (VTY) Participant Limit :- :- :- :- :- :- :- 02:30 Hockey NHL Chicago Blackhawks Calgary Flames 5,000 100 04:30 Hockey NHL San Jose Sharks Los Angeles Kings 5,000 100 18:00 Basketball Euroleague Khimki Moscow Region Fenerbahce 5,000 100 19:30 Basketball Euroleague Kauno Zalgiris Anadolu Efes 5,000 100 21:00 Football EFL Cup Tottenham Chelsea 5,000 100 # Wednesday, 09.01.2019. Chicago redditdj meetup #4 (Saturday, Oct 6) - 3PM, Milwaukee/Damen Ave Hey, everyone! So, it has been a while since the last time we did this (https://www.reddit.com/r/chicagoEDM/comments/13rspi/redditdj_meetup_3_sunday_dec_2_3pm/) and I thought it would be cool if we change that. Once again, I'd like to thank /u/kitsy and /u/addsubtract for hosting redditdj meetups in the past and once again I'd like to open up my home to you all so we can drop some tunes together.

Basically there is a rave party in a small village next to my small swiss town. It started on saturday (yesterday) at 14, I was there from 14 to 21, then came back home to eat and sleep and I have to be back there sunday (today already) at 9am for my set until 11am. I’m afraid that there will be no one at that time (people are not used to such events) or only super drunk people or junkies. Also, this is my second gig only. The first one was just mixing at a friend’s party so actually I’m. 
I thought it would be cool to see what everyone is planning to see at EDC. A lot of folks seem to be looking for recommendations, so this might be a good chance to give your own! I'm going to start with me. for obvious reasons. First, a little about me: I've been listening to electronic music since 1996. Before that, I listened to a lot of hip hop like A Tribe Called Quest and De La Soul and similar, which lead to scratching and breaks. I went to my first rave in 1998. Since Hey ya'll, i bought a used z2 sunday, and everything works great, but when i crank up either the booth or Main past halfway, it sounds distorted. I've tried rekordbox, traktor, and VDJ. My speakers are 2 EV ZLX-15P. My friend got me into trap three years ago during our freshman year of college. Although my redditing has petered out in the past several years, I have always checked r/trap to keep up with the newest music. Since then, I gradually attended more and more concerts like NGHTMRE, Keys N Krates, etc. I’ve always appreciated how the artists comment in the threads and participate actively in the community. This past summer, I found myself with a lot of free time and downloaded virtual DJ. I uploaded. Hey all, thought it might be cool to get a compilation of all the upcoming black friday plug-in/soundset/sample/DAW deals going. Post the deals you know of with a link and I'll pop them in the text of this post! EDIT : It has come to my attention that a kind gentleman by the name of George has already made a beautiful compilation over at KVR sounds. I'll paste what he posted below for the lazy. All credit goes to George! EDIT #2 : Updated the list based on KVR Updates Has anybody else had this issue whilst running Traktor with the DJM900 soundcard? I had to manually power down the laptop. It happened to me last Sunday during a set and I don't really want it to happen again. Wednesday - Sunday. ~5 hr sets each night. I've been DJing at this club for over 2 years ~20 hrs a week but this year the other DJ left and i'm picking up the slack. I don't want to give away the details of exactly which club or where it is but it's nice imo. Best job I've ever had. Pays more than enough and I have a lot of fun. I get flagship DJ equipment and fantastic lighting to play with. I won't pretend that I know everything though but I know enough, and I'm still learning. EDIT: UPDATE: Wow I never expected such a positive response. I will do my first stream of this series Sunday, March 15th at 20:00 PST (8:00PM). I will also make another post a day before the stream to remind everyone. Thank you so much. I'm excited to start :) As far as chew.tv I will be checking it out. However, I know the twitch fanbase is much higher than chew so I think my biggest chance for exposure will be on twitch. However, there may be an option where I can stream on both simultaneously. Would anyone be interested in a Reddit Meetup at a dance music venue? Its an idea we threw around in /r/DJs that seemed to get some steam from local djs willing to help out. We can consider doing a permitted park event on a sunday or saturday, which would cost approx 0-0 for permits/generators rentals/gas, with a sound system being a completely separate expense, depending on our connections here. Another option would be a night club takeover where we rent out (and/or split bar profits). 
A bit of background first: I used to make music on PC using some form of Cakewalk Sonar and a handful of software synths. For a while I talked about getting back to making music, but never felt like I had the time to sit down and do it. Last year, I started playing with iPad music apps and bought a bunch for my iPad mini 1. I loved the portability in concept, but I discovered quickly that the mini 1 wasn't powerful enough to handle Cubasis and more than one IAA synth Hi guys, I'm not sure if I'm in the right place to be posting this, but I want to get an answer from somewhere. Also, I thank you now for taking the time to actually sit through and read what I'm about to write. It might be lengthy, but it seems to me like it's the most logical way of getting what I'm going through, to be in some medium of being able to with. Let's get some of the factors out of the way first of all. My work status: I'm employed as a community support worker for adults. Hello and welcome to this week's game thread discussion/voting! Probably going to have one thread each for Saturday and Sunday. I'm personally most interested in Slovan/Avangard and Dynamo Moscow/SKA. What's the consensus? Opine below. Saturday's games: Home Time Away :---- ---- ----: (/flair-Amur) 2:00 EST/7:00 GMT/10:00 MSK (/flair-Severstal) (/flair-MetallurgNk) 6:00 EST/11:00 GMT/14:00 MSK (/flair-Vityaz) (/flair-Sibir) 6:00 EST/11:00 GMT/14:00. So I bought the Volca Bass and Beats along with the Audio 6 on Sunday mostly because I want to start making tracks, but I was also wondering if there's a way to make them sync up with Traktor? I managed to get them in to a live instrument channel on Traktor (inputs 1amp2 on Audio 6) but it was really quiet and it was split with the bass on the left channel and drums on the right, the sound comes through fine on Ableton though. Will I be able to continue using the S2 together with the Audio. </p>
